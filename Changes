        - bin/verifycert.pl
              Just get buildchain from VOMS::Lite::CertKeyHelper

        - MyProxy.pm - various fixes:
            Opened allowed username and passwords - spec doesn't care what 
              chars a username is made up of
            Fixed Cert/Key check
            Put in bail out for MyProxy server not responding correctly
            Added option to expolit verbose Proxy creation

0.09  Thu Jan 14 14:20:00 2010

          or some of its dependencied not being relocatable.
        - Removed dependency upon Crypt::RSA::Key
        - Some minor fixes ( Errors should be an array reference in REQ.pm )
        - Fixed myproxy scripts ARGV input checker 
            (server address cannot start with '-').
        - Fixed occasional error in PEM encoded data where 64 divides
          base64 number of chars.

0.10  Wed Apr  7 17:51:31 2010
        - Added library to create Audit extensions for proxy certificates

            (warning returned if DN doesn't Match but Subject Alt Name does)
        - VOMS improved Base64 handling: some VOMS servers return the encoding 
            they wish despite B value in <base64>B</base64> message.
            VOMS::Get Now examines message to determine which 
            alphabet is being used.
        - gLite's VOMS server no longer sends SSL Certificate Request
            with acceptable CA list VOMS::Get: Changed unsupported CA error 
            into a warning unless the data is available.
        - Fixed ASN1Helper::ASNLenStr: boundary between single byte length 
            encoding and multi byte length encoding now behaves correctly
        - RSAkey now searches for character device at $DefaultRandom
        - Removed Regexp dependency from AC::Create

0.11 Tue Apr 20 04:49:00 2010
        - voms-proxy-init.pl now only loads HTTP::Request and LWP::UserAgent if required
        - RSAKey::Create Now respects the Quiet option

0.12 Tue Mar 15 13:32:15 2011
        - VOMS.pm read now continues to pull from socket until it has 
            the expected ammount of data; a timeout also put in place
          - Insert extra padding in records where CBC::Decrypt chomps 
              trailing \0's.
          - Allow 0 lenght padding where record length is a multiple of 8
          - Added VOMS::List function
          - Fixed array syntax @Errors[] -> $Errors[]

            Thank you Bart Heupers for the bug report.
        - $VERSION now only exported by in Lite.pm

0.14 Thu Mar 17 10:50:00 2011
        - PAUSE didn't like me removing $VERSION from library files.
          - humph! Reverted versioning changes
          - added a script to keep versions in alignment with Lite.pm

0.15 Thu Feb 14 16:10:00 2012
        - Problem with build on PPC, tests can't generate a CA certificate
          - Added more checks in test script
        - Added extra lurve
        - VOMS servers updated to EMI release caused VOMS.pm to break
          - This was due to expecting a single encrypted record from server
            The server's move to using vanilla OpenSSL based sockets meant
            that VOMS.pm received a record with zero data before the record with
            the AC or List result.
            VOMS.pm can now handle multiple encrypted records per payload.
0.16 Tue Feb 28 01:48:00 2012
        - Removed umask in PEMHelper.pm for Win32.* OS which doesn't do umask
        - X509::Create
          - Added check: does parse CA return reference to Error Array?
          - Change unnecessarily strict check on dNSName and rfc822Name
        - Added Explicit dependency on Crypt::DES as MacOSX required double complilation
          - not sure if this will work as cannot install CPAN::Mini::Inject
        - removed Umask in VOMS::Lite.pm
        - Added fake DNS entry if Sys::Hostname doesn't provide a FQDN in tests
        - Added some extra test info
0.17 Fri Jun 29 13:00:00 2012
        - Added VOMS::Lite::SAMLHelper library in anticipation of 
          mainstream SAML VOMS services
        - Fixed error handling in VOMS::Lite::X509::Examine for 
          ["Unable to parse certificate"]
        - Fixed CA certificate check in X509::Examine.  When $CertInfoRef->{'Errors'} 
          is undefined.
        - Added ability to parse unencrypted RSA private key in PKCS#8 format.
          - Changes in VOMS::Lite::PEMHelper::readPrivateKey to also accept
           "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----" .. "-----END PRIVATE KEY-----" blocks
          - Changes in VOMS::Lite::KEY::Examine to locate internal octet string 
            and re-index to start of key data allowing key to be parsed with the
            existing algorithm.
        - Added RPM spec file (originally written by Steve Traylen)
          - Added unwin32.patch to aid automatic perl library exclusions in rpm
          - Added voms.config sample as required by spec file
        - Updated the updateversion.pl script to update version in RPM spec file
0.18 Mon Jul 02 12:05:00 2012
        - VOMS::Lite::REQ::Create
          - Checks input to identify whether request is for a host or not
          - Fixed SubjectAltName Extension request
          - Fixed Key used to sign request if pre-generated
          - Added Basic Constraints, Key usage and Extended Key Usage Extensions.
        - VOMS::Lite::PEMHelper: fixed a number of formatting issues in PEM encoding.
        - cert-req.pl
          - added -host option to force subjectAltName dnsName:...
          - add value in -email to any subjectAltName extension (if not a host cert)
        - Moved example directory to misc directory
        - Added buildRPM.sh to build rpms
        - Created 'rpm' and 'version' targets in MakeMaker generated Makefile
          - version runs updateversion.pl
          - rpm runs buildRPM.sh (creates rpms in rpm directory) 
            and depends on 'dist' and 'verstion'
        - voms-proxy-init.pl handles no Attribute Certificate scenario more gracefully.
